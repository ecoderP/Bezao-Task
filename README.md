# Bezao-Task

I had to submit before the allocated time because it says on the bezao internship landing page that today, 21st August, 2022 is the last day for application. I am not sure if this affects those that have applied already and given 3 days to complete the task (I hope for some considerations if that is the case).
I don't want to take chances, so I have submitted my links, eventhough I still have more than 2 days on the timer.

## Task one

[Live website for task one](https://www.order-meal.netlify.app)
I built this with html, CSS and javascript, using mobile first approach. The javascript is for the mobile menu.
The site is responsive at small screen sizes, even though I targeted the 768px breakpoint. It is responsive for screen sizes below 768px and screen sizes higher than 1220px. Media queries for screen sizes outside those ranges have not been fixed yet.

## Task two

I intend to use Django for this task.
